    Officially, I'm employed as a Software Engineer on Vehicle Software/Firmware Platforms.
    Myself and my team provide the bootloaders that allow Over-The-Air updates to
    deliver safety, performance, and reliability improvements to Tesla vehicles,
    chargers, powerwalls, and solar inverters all over the world.
    Additionally, I work with other teams to provide firmware development
    support for new platforms, or new prototypes, where expertise with low-level,
    real-time software is needed.
    The specifics of my work at Tesla is currently under NDA, as it involves
    features which have not launched yet.
