    Certified December 2022.
    My thesis involves Adversarial Machine Learning and generalization
    performance of Deep Neural Networks, specifically focusing on image
    classification. My work demonstrates the behavior of regularization and data
    augmentation techniques on adversarial robustness and implements InfoMixup,
    a new algorithm for robust generalization using information-constrained
    Mixup in a Gaussian latent space.

    Minor in Mathematics.
    I took the minor in math because it was a weak subject for me, and I chose to improve my skills.  I have definitely succeeded!
    Working with mathematics at a higher level has helped me to think in abstracts and be able to model difficult concepts in a simple way.
